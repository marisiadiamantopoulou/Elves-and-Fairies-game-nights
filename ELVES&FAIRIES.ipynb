    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We just opened a comic shop, 'Aurora Comics and Games'. The store also offers board game nights for local board gamers. They love to play their favorite RPG, \"Elves and Fairies!\" and will gladly pay to secure the space to do so. Game night planning is essential. If we choose the wrong night, not enough people will come and the game night will be cancelled. We decide it's best to automate the game night selector to get more people through the door. First we need to create a list of people who will be attending the game night.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create an empty list called `gamers`. This will be our list of people who are attending game night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we want to create a function that will update this list and add a new gamer to the this `gamers` list. Each `gamer` should be a dictionary with the following keys:\n",
    " - `\"name\"`: a string that contains the gamer's full name. E.g., \"Vicky Eksarxou\"\n",
    " - `\"availability\"`: a list of strings containing the names of the days of the week that the gamer is available. E.g., [\"Monday\", \"Thursday\", \"Sunday\"]\n",
    " \n",
    "So we create a function called `add_gamer` that takes two parameters: `gamer` and `gamers_list`. The function checks that the argument passed to the `gamer` parameter has both `\"name\"` and a `\"availability\"` as keys, and if so add `gamer` to `gamers_list`."
