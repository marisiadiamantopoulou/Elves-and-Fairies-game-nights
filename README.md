# Elves_and_Fairies_game_nights

Developed a game night scheduling system using Python

We just opened a comic shop, 'Aurora Comics and Games'. The store also offers board game nights for local board gamers. 
They love to play their favorite RPG, "Elves and Fairies!" and will gladly pay to secure the space to do so. Game night planning is essential. 
If we choose the wrong night, not enough people will come and the game night will be cancelled.
We decide it's best to automate the game night selector to get more people through the door.
